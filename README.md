Welcome!

What is TomProject?

Its a collection of useful Java components and algorithms both from own and third party authory.
Most of this project is dedicated, but not limited, to the Java SE Desktop community.
The algorithms include desktop application memory manager, Swing utilities, Swing interface translation, and many Swing's components extensions.
TomProject will be available, initially, with Portuguese and English component interfaces.

Some features of TomProject:
- TomFrame provides a configured frame for general use.
- TomMainFrame provides a configured frame to begin your desktop application.
- TomFrame and TomDialog are automatic centralized.
- TomPanel provides a panel with simple setLayout methods that promote a less verbose code.
- TomPanel setWaitCursor() and setDefaultCursor() provides easy mouse cursor manipulation to your swing application.
- TomAction provides a new and very less verbose approach to handle swing actions.
- MemoryWarningSystem (3th party adapted component) shows a message to user in case of low available memory for the JVM.
- And much more that I'll describe here as I have time for.. :)

Code license

This project has no restrictions.
In a fast look at the most common licenses, I found the MIT as the most "open" licence. If is not, please, let me know (use the Issues tab, or the discussion group).

External dependencies

TomProject is powered by the Project Lombok (projectlombok.org) - needed only if you want to handle the source code.
